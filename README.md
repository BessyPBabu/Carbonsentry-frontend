# CarbonSentry

## Project Overview

CarbonSentry is a carbon compliance and vendor management platform built to help organizations track, verify, and manage carbon-related compliance data in one place.

Many organizations work with multiple vendors and are required to collect carbon compliance documents, validate them, and prove compliance during audits. Today, this process is often manual, scattered across emails and spreadsheets, and difficult to audit.

CarbonSentry centralizes this entire workflow into a structured system.

## The Problem

Organizations face several common problems when managing carbon compliance:

- Vendor documents are stored in emails, folders, or spreadsheets
- No clear visibility into which vendors are compliant or non-compliant
- Manual document verification is time-consuming and error-prone
- Roles and responsibilities are unclear across teams
- Audit preparation requires collecting data from multiple sources

These issues lead to **compliance risks, operational delays, and poor accountability**.

## The Solution

CarbonSentry solves these problems by providing:

- A **centralized platform** for managing vendors and compliance documents
- **Role-based access control** so each user sees only what they are allowed to
- Structured **vendor onboarding and document tracking**
- Clear compliance status and risk visibility
- An **audit-ready system** with proper logging and traceability

By automating and structuring the compliance workflow, CarbonSentry reduces manual effort, improves transparency, and helps organizations stay compliant with confidence.

CarbonSentry is designed with a clean, modular architecture to support long-term scalability and real-world compliance needs.
